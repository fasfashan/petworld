# Slicing design to HTML and CSS. The first step to learn Front End Development

This simple project is my first step in starting to learn programming, especially in the realm of Front End Development. Previously, I had learned quite a lot, and had attended a bootcamp. However, I feel that my fundamentals are not yet strong and I often go through several basics that I should learn first.

Apart from being here, I also share my stories in learning programming on my Twitter, you can visit the thread [here.](https://twitter.com/fasfashan/status/1658783377271717889?s=20)

## What I learned on this project

HTML and CSS. Yes, those are the only two that I want to learn in this project. As I said before, I often go through basic things that should be understood more deeply. Especially for CSS, I will not use any framework or assistance to strengthen my fundamentals in CSS.
